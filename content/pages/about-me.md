About me
========

I am a Staff software engineer working within the sphere of people, tech and
processes. Within these three, _quick feedback, iterations and failing fast_
are core tennets that gets me going.

**People.** There is nothing like seeing an enabled team or engineer.
Instilling psychological safety, mentoring and sharing knowledge are things I
value a lot.

**Tech.** I have a strong background within backend product development,
software architecture, service-oriented architecture, DevOps, site reliability
engineering and platform (developer enablement) engineering. I'm a little rusty
on the web frontend side, but should pick that up at some point again... You
can find some of my tech insights and learnings over the years [here][quora].

**Processes.** A good process is one does solves a problem, preferably is
automated, and *does not stand in the way to get things done*. As [the agile
manifest][agile] states

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

I have a MSc in Engineering Mathematics from [Lund Institute of
Technology](http://www.lth.se/english/) (LTH), Sweden.

I can also be found in other various corners of the web. Please see [the links
