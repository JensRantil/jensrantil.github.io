About me
========

I am a Staff software engineer working within the sphere of people, tech, and
processes. _Quick feedback, iterations, and failing fast_ are core tenets and of
high value to me. I aim to be a [force multiplier][force-multiplier-book].

**People.** I find pleasure in enabling teams and individuals in their daily
work by improving psychological safety, mentoring, and sharing knowledge.

**Tech.** I have a strong background in backend product development, software
architecture, service-oriented architecture, DevOps, site reliability
engineering, and [platform engineering][platform-engineering]. Some of my tech

**Processes.** A good process is one that solves a problem while [minimizing
waste][muda]. I strive for *individuals and interactions over processes and
tools* ([The Agile Manifesto][agile]), and *automation over manual work*.
