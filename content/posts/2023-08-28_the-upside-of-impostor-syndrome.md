The upside of [Impostor Syndrome][impostor-syndrome] is that it means that you
have the capabitity of self-reflection — the possibility to look at yourself
with critical eyes.  This is actually a healthy thing in small doses. I am sure
most of us have worked with a colleague who say “this is the only way” and “we
have tried that, it will never work”. These are narrow-minded engineers closed
off to reconsider alternative solutions and explanations - they lack a healthy
sense of self-reflection.

[impostor-syndrome]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome

The world is full of tradeoffs; The best engineers are great at self-reflection
and constantly question the route they have taken, asking themselves “which
solution is the best given this situation?“.

So if impostor syndrome kicks in, remember that it comes from a healthy place
of self-reflection, just magnified. Not everyone are good at self-reflecting,
so treat it with respect (but don’t take it too seriously). If you water the
seed of Impostor Syndrome well, it can make you bloom into a great engineer.
