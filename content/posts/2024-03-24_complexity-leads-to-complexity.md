Recently, I have been seeing more and more examples where complex solutions leads to more complexity. To me, this means there is a hidden future cost to every complex solution.

Let me give some examples:

 * Tests are liability. Complexity => lots of tests => moving slowy.
 * Using system tests instead of unit tests. Suddently handling flaky tests.
 * Make it async. LINK TO FORMER BLOG POST
 * Making it event-driven.
 * Using OO inheritance leads to more and more parameters.
