I am a sucker for "quick feedback". Usually, this applies to software
development: Unit tests should execute fast, CI/CD should fail fast, and
minimum bureaucracy between coding and deploying, quick deployments, automated
alerts when something fails, etc.

Usually what most people think about when they talk about "quick feedback" are
the above engineering practices. But the softer side of being an engineer also
benefits from quick feedback. That's why I would like to talk about
_microretros_ today.

Most of us have heard about _retrospectives_ (short: _retro_). It's a meeting
where you look ("spective") back ("retro") and reflect on what has happened,
and come up with actionable tasks to

1. continue doing things that do well; as well as
2. improve on things that are not going so well.

Retrospectives usually happen with a regular cadence. For example, at the end
of a sprint, or every 2nd/3rd/4th week.

I love retrospectives. In fact, for years I have been telling people that if
there is _one_ process they should have in place, it is regular retrospectives.
Why? Because retrospectives make your organization, or team, self-correct based
on what goes well and what doesn't. It's a way for you to learn. New processes,
experiments, and learnings all come out of this one ceremony.

But can we do better? Can we as an organization or team learn from our mistakes
faster and make smaller course corrections more often? I believe yes, and one
tool for that is Microretros.

A _Microretro_ is where you take a tiny slice out of the end of an interaction
with other team members and ask them "What did you think about this session?".
A working session could be everything from a meeting, a workshop, a mob/pair
programming session, or a tough conversation. It is a small practice where you
actively gather feedback to learn and course correct, but at a microscale.

Literally spending 1-2 minutes out of an interaction doing this can have an
immense impact over time on a team. If you were facilitating the meeting it can
also be a great source of improvement to become an awesome facilitator over
time!

If the participants are many, or time is very limited, you can ask for "a fist
of five". At the count of three, all participants hold up 0-5 using their
fingers to show how valuable the session was. Then ask the people giving the
lowest score to name _one thing_ that would have given a higher score.

In short, a Microretros is a small useful tool for learning & course
correction, often. On top of that, it can be a great way to start building a
healthy feedback culture between you and your colleagues.
