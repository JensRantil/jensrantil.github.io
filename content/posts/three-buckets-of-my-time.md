I have a framework for how I carve out my professional time. It was taught to
me informally by a former colleague and I adopted it to be personal time
framework. Essentially, I think of my time spent into three buckets:

 * Team work
 * Company-wide work
 * My own initiatives

Let's go through them one by one:

## Team work ("team bucket")

Time spent in the "team work" bucket is time I spend on tasks related to the local team I am
primarily working with. Usually these tasks are tied to issues in a ticketing
system, team ceremonies such as retros or planning etc.

## Company-wide work ("company bucket")

"Company-wide work" is work spent that is related to things outside of my team.
Usually the work impacts either the entire engineering organisation, the entire
company, or at least multiple teams.

Tasks in this bucket tend to be more strategic and "extra curricular". These
are usually requests coming in from the company and are not related to the
responsibilities within the team.

## My own initiatives ("me bucket")

These are my personal initiatives which come from my thoughts, ideas and
visions after for example reading an article, learning something new or trying
out a new piece of technology. It’s that act that gives me energy and a sense
of forwardness.  My initiatives can also take the form of thinking about a new
technical strategy, building some tool to simplify my day or coding up and a
proof of concept to showcase it. “Hackday” is a good example of where I think
it's a good time for me to spend in this bucket. 

I have found that a surprisingly amount of innovation happens in this bucket.

## Time distribution between buckets of time

How much time is spent in the different buckets depends on your role expectations.

However, the distribution between the time spent in the different buckets also
changes dynamically with situation and context. For example, sometimes I need
to charge with some individual initiatives if I have worked on mundane team or
company tasks.  Or sometimes I have spent too much time on company-wide
initiatives and need to start spending slightly more time in my team to help
them out.

## Widening the efforts of engineers

I have also found that using this model has yielded more strategic initiatives
and innovation, both for myself and others. It is easy for engineers to get
stuck in the "I need to only do work in my team" silo. By encouraging engineers
to slice their time into these three buckets, it implicitly reminds them that
we all are allowed to decide ourselves what to work on - we don't only need to
be ticket machines in our local team. This increases autonomy, which [has
positive effects on motivation][dan-pink].

This model can be of use to someone else. It has certainly been to me.
