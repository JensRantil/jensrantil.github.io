I have a small framework for how I carve out my (professional) time. It was
taught to me informally by a former colleague a long time ago. Essentially, I
think of my time spent into three buckets:

 * Team work
 * Company-wide work
 * Individual initiatives

Let's go through them one by one:

## Team work ("team bucket")

Time spent in the "team work" bucket are tasks related to the local team I am
primarily working in. Usually the tasks are tied to issues in a ticketing
system, but it can also be team ceremonies such as retros, planning etc.

## Company-wide work ("company bucket")

"Company-wide work" is work spent that is related to things outside of my team.
Usually the work impacts either the entire engineering organisation, the entire
company, or at least multiple teams.

Tasks in this bucket tend to be more strategic and "extra curricular". These
are usually requests coming in from the company and are not related to the
responsibilities the team I am in has.

## Individual initiatives ("me bucket")

These are initiatives usually coming from me. They are things _I_ want to do
and give me energy. They can include learning something new, like reading blog
articles or trying out a new piece of technology. It can also be thinking about
technical strategy, building some small tool to simplify my day, or coding up a
small proof of concept I've been wanting to try out and showcase to someone. If
my team has the concept of "hackday" I usually think of that as time spend in
this bucket.

I have found that a surprisingly amount of innovation happens in this bucket.

## Time distribution between buckets of time

How much is spent in the different buckets depends on your role expectations.
For example, when I worked as a Staff Engineer I aimed for something like a
33%/33%/33% split.

However, the distribution between the time spent in the different buckets also
changes dynamically with time. For example, sometimes I need to charge with
some individual initiatives if I have worked on mundane team or company tasks.
Or sometimes I have spent too much time on company-wide initiatives and need to
start spending slightly more time in my team to help them out.

## Widening the efforts of engineers

I have also found that using this model has yielded more strategic initiatives
and innovation, both for myself and others. It is easy for engineers to get
stuck in the "I need to only do work in my team" silo. By encouraging engineers
to slice their time into these three buckets, it implicitly reminds them that
we all are allowed to decide ourselves what to work on - we don't only need to
be ticket machines in our local team. This increases autonomy, which [has
positive effects on motivation][dan-pink].

Maybe this model might be of use to someone else. It has certainly been to me.
