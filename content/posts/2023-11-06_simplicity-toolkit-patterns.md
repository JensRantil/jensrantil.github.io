INTRO

## A little copying over a little dependency

A little copying is better than a little dependency.

## Small interfaces over larger

## Shallow call hierarchies over deep

## Polling over pushing

## Orchestration over choreography

## Small changes over larger

## Deploy often over long-lived feature branches

## Well-defined architecture over perfect code

It's possible to write crappy code in a well architected system. However, in a well architected system you know that the crap is isolated and easily replaceable. Focus on a sane decoupled architecture first. The rest can be cleaned up later if on a tight schedule.
