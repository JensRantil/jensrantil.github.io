I think calling someone, including yourself, a “junior” engineer can have a
negative effect. Let me explain:

The label is very black and white and that’s not how the world works. There is
a wide range of knowledge involving being an engineer; You are good at some
things and less good at other things. I am sure that a “junior engineer” is
much better at some things than a more senior engineer who has worked for a
long time in the industry. “Junior” implies that you have little knowledge
about all the things. Instead of saying “[…] as me, who is quite Junior”, say
something like “[…] as me, who know less about X”. By avoiding calling yourself
“junior”, you have one less mantra repeating that you know less than most
people — and you avoid getting stuck there.

Similarly, calling someone else “junior” can have a similar effect, so I avoid it.

Finally, my official title these days is “senior software engineer” but I never
call myself “senior” ever except maybe in a sales call with a customer. I am
simply “an engineer”. Possibly a tenured one. And I expect my knowledge to
shine through the questions I ask, the answers I give, and the things I build.
That’s what we should value. IMO, titles are mostly for engineering ladders and
salary settings.
