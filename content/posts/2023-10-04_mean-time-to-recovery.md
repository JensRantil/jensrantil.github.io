Today I would like to talk about why Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) is a wrong
metric to look at.

For the past few years many software engineers have been using [the DORA
metrics][dora] to track the performance of software delivery. One of the DORA
metrics is "Time to Restore Service", also known as "Mean Time To Recovery
(MTTR)". A couple of years ago Courtney Nash wrote ["MTTR is a Misleading
Metric—Now What?"][now-what] she criticized that the MTTR concept is too
simplistic. I could not agree more.

When I recently wrote [Mean vs. Median][mean-vs-median], I was reminded of
Courtney's

In essence, she was saying that using the _mean_ as a performance number for
recovery times is a quite useless number.

Just like software engineers are using percentiles as a performance number for
latencies, we should be using _percentiles_ when analyzing recovery times. A
recovery time is just a latency to fix something, but usually in minutes/hours
instead of milliseconds/seconds.  We want to be able to know that the recovery
time for 95% of all incidents is being reduced; Mean does not say anything
about that.

So why is MTTR used in the first place and not PTTR (Percentile of Time To
Recover)? Probably because a mean is so much easier to calculate. DORA metrics
are gathered from lots of companies, and [percentiles are
hard][mean-vs-median].
