So it's time to kick off this blog. I cheated a little and posted [a
previously written blog post](|filename|replacing-directory-in-svn.rst).
It was posted on a personal blog that mostly had Swedish material.

My intent with this blog will be to "put a URL on my tech and possibly
entrepreneurship thoughts, in English". If you'd like to know more about
me, check out that brand new [About Me](|filename|pages/about-me.rst)
page!
