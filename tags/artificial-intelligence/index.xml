Suddenly, it feels like &lt;em>every&lt;/em> single company frontpage on the Internet says it is either &amp;ldquo;an AI company&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;using AI to do X&amp;rdquo;. It is as if the whole world has discovered that computers can do smart things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But let me tell you what feels like a little secret these days: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI has been around since the 1950s&lt;/a>. In 1950, Alan Turing published “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, introducing the Turing Test and seriously framing the question of whether machines can think. The term &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy and is widely considered to mark the birth of AI as an academic discipline.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
