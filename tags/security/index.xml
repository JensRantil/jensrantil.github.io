&lt;p>I have a slight variation on this which I call &amp;ldquo;Raise and Release&amp;rdquo;, which happens &lt;em>before&lt;/em> a decision has been made. I use this principle particularly when someone proposes something I strongly disagree with &amp;ndash; or know will fail &amp;ndash; but for cases where I can&amp;rsquo;t affect the actual decision. Usually, it is for cases where I am &amp;ldquo;consulted&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;informed&amp;rdquo; in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RACI&lt;/a> sense.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CrowdStrike: Risk assessment is better off at the sharp end</title><link>https://jensrantil.github.io/posts/centralised-risk-management/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 17:36:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jensrantil.github.io/posts/centralised-risk-management/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I wanted to write something about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike_incident" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the recent CrowdStrike Falcon incident&lt;/a> and about one contributing factor, namely &lt;em>centralised risk management&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I recently watched &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEYN38nir_w" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the trailer&lt;/a> for the movie &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeIucLnEa24" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;Safety Differently&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> by Sidney Dekker. One of the things it talks about is that &lt;strong>the farther you are from a system, the less effective your risk management is likely to be&lt;/strong>. This includes assessing risks and putting controls in place to mitigate those risks. Or to put it another way, the operators of a system &lt;em>at the edge&lt;/em> are usually the best people to do risk assessment, come up with controls, and defend against catastrophes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Security is just one part of risk</title><link>https://jensrantil.github.io/posts/security-and-risk/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2024 10:28:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jensrantil.github.io/posts/security-and-risk/</guid><description>&lt;p>I think our software industry sometimes is blindsided when it comes to
security. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I am of course in favor of good security
practices. But I think we could get better at understanding the trade-offs when
improving security.&lt;/p>
