&lt;p>The ultimate quality assurance is when customers get their hands on your
software and actually try it. &lt;em>That&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em> when you know if your software does what
it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do or not. This happens in production.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Every technical decision has a tradeoff, but certain things are
rarely challenged in our industry. Having a staging environment&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and having
every change go through that staging environment, are two of those things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what is a staging environment? It is a full replica of a production
environment. Do you have a backend service running in production? Then you also
need that service in staging. Do you have a database in production? Then you
need a database in your staging environment. Etcetera. Most companies having a
staging environment require every change to first go through staging to verify
that the change works before hitting production.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
