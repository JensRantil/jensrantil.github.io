immediately turn to making the API &lt;em>do more in one unit of work&lt;/em>. I think this
pattern can be very harmful and have many battle scars from this. So I thought
I would write a post about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="an-example">
 An example
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#an-example">
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading">&lt;/i>
 &lt;span class="sr-only">Link to heading&lt;/span>
 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with an example: You have a web service that stores TODO items. It
has an API endpoint, &lt;code>POST /todo&lt;/code>, which gets called to add a new TODO item.
Here is an example request/response:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I'm a State Engineer. Are you, too?</title><link>https://jensrantil.github.io/posts/lifecycles-and-states/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jensrantil.github.io/posts/lifecycles-and-states/</guid><description>&lt;p>TL;DR: We need to have a more thorough discussion about state and
lifecycles in our industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently revisited &lt;a href="http://12factor.net" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Twelve-Factor App&lt;/a> by
&lt;a href="https://www.heroku.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroku&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s a great read if you are deploying
your own application, are interested in (organizational and/or
technincal) scaling or curious of best practices when it comes to
deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I was reading the manifest it struck me that there are two words that
I hear all too infrequently in our industry, namely &lt;em>state&lt;/em> and
&lt;em>lifecycle&lt;/em>. The words have different meaning, yet they are related in
so many ways. All state has a lifecycle, otherwise the state would not
be worth thinking of.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
