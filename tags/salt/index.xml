I&amp;rsquo;ve
heard opinions from someone I respect that
&lt;a href="http://puppetlabs.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puppet&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.getchef.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chef&lt;/a> were
complicated beasts to get up and running, and since I am a Python guy
I&amp;rsquo;ve generally always kept an eye on &lt;a href="http://www.ansible.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ansible&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="http://www.saltstack.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salt&lt;/a>. Ruby is so far not my thing, but
hey let&amp;rsquo;s not start a flamewar about that!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last year I got to spend a good 6 months working with Ansible for
provisioning of servers. I became very familiar with the tool. In that
project, Ansible was mostly chosen because it was easy to get started
and had good documentation. The team I was working with was especially
fond of the &lt;a href="http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_best_practices.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best
Practises&lt;/a>
documentation which got us started quickly and taught us what structure
had worked previously.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
