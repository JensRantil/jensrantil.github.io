&lt;p>Today I would like to talk about why Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) is a wrong
metric to look at.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the past few years many software engineers have been using &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the DORA
metrics&lt;/a> to track the performance of software delivery. One of the DORA
metrics is &amp;ldquo;Time to Restore Service&amp;rdquo;, also known as &amp;ldquo;Mean Time To Recovery
(MTTR)&amp;rdquo;. A couple of years ago Courtney Nash wrote &lt;a href="https://www.verica.io/blog/mttr-is-a-misleading-metric-now-what/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;MTTR is a Misleading
Metricâ€”Now What?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> where she criticized that the MTTR concept is too
simplistic. I could not agree more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mean vs. median</title><link>https://jensrantil.github.io/posts/mean-vs-median/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 22:22:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jensrantil.github.io/posts/mean-vs-median/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the years, I have heard many people say something like&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Over 50% of people think they are better than the average car driver.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>They say this as if it&amp;rsquo;s funny or sounds smart. But the fact is that actually
could be true, and the reason is because &lt;em>mean and median are not the same
thing&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When people take a basic course in statistics, they are likely to come out of
it thinking that the world mostly consists of normal distributions. That is not
surprising, given that the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Central Limit Theorem&lt;/a> states that many
independent variables with the same distribution converges to a normal
distribution. This does not apply everywhere. The Central Limit Theorem means
students leave Statistics 101 having a visual representation of a statistical
distribution of a bell curve. I believe this has created a lot of confusion.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
