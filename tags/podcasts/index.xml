We recorded it on the 8th of
December, it was published &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgia-benton-b899ba13b_evo-nordics-475-sre-ownership-activity-7156768373861699584-FClp?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced&lt;/a> on the 25th of January, and I finally took the time
to listen to it fully - and vetted it worthy of sharing. &amp;#x1f605; I
thought I would write a little bit about the experience.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It all started with me being reached out to by Georgia (the host) at &lt;a href="https://evolutionjobs.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evolution
Jobs&lt;/a>. Alex, one of the podcast guests that I had met a few weeks
earlier had recommended me and had an idea for a topic that he thought we all
would be able to contribute to - &lt;strong>SRE &amp;amp; Full Ownership&lt;/strong>. I accepted. I felt
this was a topic I would naturally be able to have a conversation around and
have opinions on; The &amp;ldquo;Full Ownership&amp;rdquo; part was very close to &lt;em>DevOps as a
Culture&lt;/em> which is something near and dear to me - and I have been working in
the SRE space for many years.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
