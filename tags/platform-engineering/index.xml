Engineering is a rather bad idea. Let me explain why:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These days &lt;a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/future-ops-platform-engineering" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is all the rage around Platform Engineering&lt;/a>,
and in fact I spent my last few years at &lt;code>$previousEmployer&lt;/code> doing exactly
this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the core tenets of &amp;ldquo;Platform Engineering&amp;rdquo; is the concept of
&lt;a href="https://blog.cycloid.io/user-friendly-developer-self-service-the-key-to-platform-engineering" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;self-serve&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>. That is, instead of a Platform team acting as a
blocker, you instead make sure to build a developer experience (DevEx) that
enables engineers to do something themselves exactly when they need it. Just In
Time! For example, if developers need a database they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to reach
out to the Platform Engineering team and ask for one. Instead, they should
simply be able to easily fire up a new database themselves within a few
minutes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
