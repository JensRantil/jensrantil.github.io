&lt;p>I have a slight variation on this which I call &amp;ldquo;Raise and Release&amp;rdquo;, which happens &lt;em>before&lt;/em> a decision has been made. I use this principle particularly when someone proposes something I strongly disagree with &amp;ndash; or know will fail &amp;ndash; but for cases where I can&amp;rsquo;t affect the actual decision. Usually, it is for cases where I am &amp;ldquo;consulted&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;informed&amp;rdquo; in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RACI&lt;/a> sense.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The hidden opportunity in feedback</title><link>https://jensrantil.github.io/posts/the-hidden-opportunity-in-feedback/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 23:18:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jensrantil.github.io/posts/the-hidden-opportunity-in-feedback/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I would like to talk about a missed opportunity when giving and receiving
feedback &amp;ndash; mainly the discussion that happens afterwards. A classical way to
give feedback is using the &lt;em>observed-perceived&lt;/em> method:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Describe the &lt;em>observed behavior&lt;/em> from your point of view. Do it as soon as
possible about the specific behavior that occurs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Describe the &lt;em>perceived impact&lt;/em> of the observed behavior.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, what commonly follows is that the receiver of the feedback
explains why the observed behavior was so &amp;ndash; followed by ending the feedback
session. &amp;ldquo;Thanks for your feedback, Jens! I did that because X, Y, &amp;amp; Z.&amp;rdquo;, then
walking away thinking&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
