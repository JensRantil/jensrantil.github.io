some of my own learnings and thoughts when it comes to data-driven teams:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was part of a big push to introduce service levels at my previous job. The
objective of the project was to make our company data-driven when it came to

&lt;em>freshness&lt;/em> does not help - that means that quality assurance must be done
continuously and treated as a &lt;a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">service level&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
