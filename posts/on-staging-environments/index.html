software and actually try it. <em>That&rsquo;s</em> when you know if your software does what
it&rsquo;s supposed to do or not. This happens in production.</p></blockquote><p>Every technical decision has a tradeoff, but certain things are
rarely challenged in our industry. Having a staging environment<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, and having
every change go through that staging environment, are two of those things.</p><p>So, what is a staging environment? It is a full replica of a production
environment. Do you have a backend service running in production? Then you also
need that service in staging. Do you have a database in production? Then you
need a database in your staging environment. Etcetera. Most companies having a
staging environment require every change to first go through staging to verify
that the change works before hitting production.</p><h2 id=reasons-for-_not_-having-a-staging-environment>Reasons for <em>not</em> having a staging environment
<a class=heading-link href=#reasons-for-_not_-having-a-staging-environment><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>There are multiple reasons why I consider having, and using, a staging
environment as <a href=/posts/waste-in-software-development/>wasteful</a>. They can be summed up in three big categories:</p><ul><li>A staging environment gives a false sense of safety.</li><li>It slows down developer velocity.</li><li>It has a high operational and financial cost.</li></ul><p>Let me explain:</p><h3 id=not-sustainable-over-time>Not sustainable over time
<a class=heading-link href=#not-sustainable-over-time><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>As engineers, we are all encouraged to build up automated test suites (unit
tests, etc.) to make sure that tests can verify that today&rsquo;s behavior will work
in the future. Manual testing, such as the one used in a staging environment,
is frowned upon in our industry. Yet, why are we doing it? I think staging
environments encourage manual testing. If we want to Build Quality In&#8482;&#xfe0f;, we
need automated testing. If we need automated testing, we need to stop manual
testing. A great way to stop manual testing is to not have a staging
environment.</p><h3 id=bottlenecked-shared-resource>Bottlenecked shared resource
<a class=heading-link href=#bottlenecked-shared-resource><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><blockquote><p>Good morning! Could everyone hold off with your deploys for then ext hour?
We are testing something on staging.</p></blockquote><p>The more engineers you have, the more a staging environment will bottleneck as
a testing ground. One team is testing something and want a stable environment
to make sure that no other bugs randomly pop up. By definition, they can&rsquo;t control
which other changes are made to the environment since it is shared between
teams.</p><h3 id=version-surprises>Version surprises
<a class=heading-link href=#version-surprises><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>Let&rsquo;s say services A & B both have the following CI pipeline: <code>code review -> staging -> [approval] -> production</code> The <code>[approval]</code> step means that the
deployment flow is what is called a &ldquo;staged rollout&rdquo;.</p><p>If each service is being deployed from version 1 to version 2, the version
combinations in production for services A & B can then be (1, 1), (1, 2), (2,
1), and (2, 2). Four combinations! For three services, that&rsquo;s eight
combinations.</p><p>Needless to say, the number of version combinations that could be running in
production grows exponentially - and making sure to cover all the cases becomes
an impossibility. By skipping staging we would know that what is running in
production is what is the latest version in our source code. Much simpler,
fewer surprises.</p><h3 id=batched-deploys>Batched deploys
<a class=heading-link href=#batched-deploys><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>Continuing on the topic of staged rollout above, the manual <code>[approval]</code> step
requires manual work. And manual work tends to happen less often. This means
that there are multiple changes lined up in staging to be deployed to
production. While this gives an increased sense of safety, this actually has
the opposite effect:</p><p>It makes it much harder to debug if a deployment breaks in production. Which of
the 6 changes have a bug in it? What did we change? Had we deployed each change
individually to production, we would immediately know which change was bad.</p><p>Deployers are not <em>really</em> reviewing what is going out in production because
the list is just too big.</p><h3 id=a-false-sense-of-safety>A false sense of safety
<a class=heading-link href=#a-false-sense-of-safety><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>I have heard the argument &ldquo;So, if we don&rsquo;t test it in staging - how do we know
if it works in production?&rdquo;. There is an assumption that everything that works
on staging will work in production. As most Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)
are aware of, this isn&rsquo;t true. By definition, a staging environment is
<em>different</em> than production. Here are some common things that can differ
between staging and production:</p><ul><li>The amount of data being stored.</li><li>The actual data being stored. Production usually have a lot of surprises&mldr;</li><li>Traffic patterns</li><li>Runtime configuration (CPU, memory, application configuration&mldr;)</li><li>Feature flags</li><li>Different database schema (by mistake).</li><li>And more&mldr;</li></ul><p><strong>Believing that a change will work in production if it works on staging is a
fallacy.</strong></p><h3 id=we-need-to-test-our-infrastructure-changes>&ldquo;We need to test our infrastructure changes&rdquo;
<a class=heading-link href=#we-need-to-test-our-infrastructure-changes><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>Infrastructure changes <em>can</em> be safely done without a staging environment, but
it requires a different mindset. The key is to think about gradual rollouts and
routing of new functionality. See the bottom of this article for some
staging-independent ways to do this.</p><p>Here are some staging-independent ways to test things in production without
negatively impacting users:</p><ul><li>Feature flags on users or accounts to route to different infrastructure.</li><li><a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy-weighted.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Weighted round-robin DNS records.</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/JensRantil/java-canary-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#weightedshardedbuilder" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Partitioning of users based on identifiers in source code</a>
to route to different infrastructure. For example &ldquo;all users with UUID
starting with &lsquo;00&rsquo; use the new cache cluster&rdquo;.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/JensRantil/java-canary-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#weightedroundrobinbuilder" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Round-robin users in source code</a> to different infrastructure
components.</li></ul><p>I think the engineers who are best at this, are the true DevOps engineers who
can freely move between being a developer and operations person. Knowing where
to introduce the new functionality gradually is key.</p><p>Being able to do the above requires a strong focus on good observability. How
will you make sure that your change doesn&rsquo;t break anything?</p><h3 id=cost>Cost
<a class=heading-link href=#cost><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>A staging environment has infrastructure costs. For complex systems, this cost
can be significant. Every service you run in production must run in staging.
Every database running in production, must also run one in staging. Databases
can be expensive&mldr;</p><p>There is also the cost of maintaining a staging environment. This is either
salary costs for more engineers or slower development. See more below.</p><h3 id=slower-feedback-cycle-in-the-development-of-software>Slower feedback cycle in the development of software
<a class=heading-link href=#slower-feedback-cycle-in-the-development-of-software><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>The DORA metric &ldquo;lead time to production&rdquo; is defined as the average time it
takes to get a change out in production. If every change must go through a
staging environment, it will significantly impact this metric negatively.</p><p>&ldquo;get a change out in production&rdquo; also includes rollbacks. If there is a bug
rolled out to production it will take much longer to revert that change if it
also needs to go out to a staging environment.</p><h3 id=foundation-for-miscommunication>Foundation for miscommunication
<a class=heading-link href=#foundation-for-miscommunication><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>If you have ever worked at a company with a staging environment I am sure you
have occasionally been confused because the user you are looking for doesn&rsquo;t
exist in the environment you are looking at. You are looking at the wrong
environment. If there are multiple environments, communicating which
environment must happen in <em>every internal bug report conversation</em>:
Slack/IM/chat/e-mail conversation must include which environment. This has a
cost.</p><p>I have debugged issues for more than one hour only to realize that the issue
only happens in one environment but not the other.</p><h3 id=but-we-need-to-test-those-ux-changes>&ldquo;But we need to test those UX changes&rdquo;
<a class=heading-link href=#but-we-need-to-test-those-ux-changes><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>I agree that getting feedback on UX changes can be a challenge. While it <em>is</em>
possibly to codify automated UX tests using Selenium and/or Playwright,
manually testing a UX is pretty much a requirement to get early feedback on how
a UX <em>feels</em>.</p><p>A full staging environment is <em>not</em> a requirement to be able to do this. It can
be done by starting up a <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/pr-previews.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>frontend preview per pull request</a>, and
have that frontend pointing to a production backend.</p><p>Or even better, wrap your new UX change behind a feature flag and have your
colleagues, alpha, or beta testers test it in production!</p><p>A pull request environment as a full replica of a production environment has
all the same downsides as having a staging environment. I would avoid that.</p><h4 id=but-we-need-to-test-the-frontend-changes-with-the-backend-changes>&ldquo;But we need to test the frontend changes with the backend changes&rdquo;
<a class=heading-link href=#but-we-need-to-test-the-frontend-changes-with-the-backend-changes><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h4><p>Deploy your backend changes with backward compatibility. Then test your
frontend changes. Simple as that. Deploying a frontend and a backend change as
an &ldquo;atomic&rdquo; deploy is a bad practice anyway.</p><h3 id=but-we-need-to-have-it-for-security-reasons>&ldquo;But we need to have it for security reasons&rdquo;
<a class=heading-link href=#but-we-need-to-have-it-for-security-reasons><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>Some companies implement a separation between staging and production data by
having a staging environment. There are other, cheaper, controls that can solve
that in a completely different way; Tag all users as either being a test user
or a production user. And introduce access control based on this tag.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also worth pointing out that having two environments will <em>not</em> protect
anyone from leaking data between two production users which in my opinion is a
much more serious bug.</p><p>I think having a staging environment is a good example of <a href=/posts/security-and-risk/>a security control
that doesn&rsquo;t consider other forms of risks</a>.</p><h2 id=ways-to-relax-the-dependency-on-a-staging-environment>Ways to relax the dependency on a staging environment

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Here are some staging-independent ways to test things in production without
negatively impacting users:</p><ul><li>Partitioning users by using feature flags on users or accounts.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/JensRantil/java-canary-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#weightedshardedbuilder" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Partitioning users based on identifiers in source code</a> to

deployments&rdquo;.</li><li>Pull request environments to mostly test frontend changes.</li><li>Smoke tests to make sure a deployment rolled out properly.</li><li>End-to-end tests to make sure that important user flows work after a
deployment.</li><li>Automatic rollback on errors. This can be done both on an
infrastructure level, but much simpler <a href="https://github.com/JensRantil/java-canary-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#circuitbreakerfallbackbuilder" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>on intra-service level in
source code</a>.</li></ul><p>In the article <a href=https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>&ldquo;Why CEOs are failing software engineers and other creative
teams&rdquo;</a>, Gene Bond talks about how Creative Management has the goal
to to drive down the cost of failure, not the number of failures. This is
exactly what some of these tools do.</p><h2 id=reasons-for-_having_-a-staging-environment>Reasons for <em>having</em> a staging environment
<a class=heading-link href=#reasons-for-_having_-a-staging-environment><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>I have seen staging environments being required for compliance reasons. That&rsquo;s
a valid reason! If I would end up in that situation, I would make sure to at
least deploy to production and staging in parallel, if I could.</p><p>There <em>might</em> occasionally be a reason where you might want to have a
production replica temporarily if you are doing a big rewrite of something.
That said, <a href=https://skamille.medium.com/avoiding-the-rewrite-trap-b1283b8dd39e class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>big rewrites are generally bad</a>, so I would avoid it.</p><p>Apart from the above, I am struggling to find real good long-term reasons for
having a staging environment.</p><h2 id=closing-thoughts>Closing thoughts
<a class=heading-link href=#closing-thoughts><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Certain workplaces have <em>more</em> than one pre-production environment (&ldquo;staging&rdquo;,
&ldquo;testing&rdquo;, &ldquo;qa&rdquo;, &ldquo;pre-production&rdquo;&mldr; - hello banks! &#x1f44b;&#x1f60a;). Suffice to
say, everything in this document applies to all of these pre-production
environments proportionally to the number of additional environments that need
to be maintained.</p><p>Having a staging environment can be useful for <a href=https://orghacking.com/pioneers-settlers-town-planners-wardley-9dcd3709cde7 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>town planners</a>.
But if a company values moving quickly over risk averseness, I would strongly
suggest to not have a staging environment.</p><h2 id=references>References
