<a class=heading-link href=#cqrs-and-event-sourcing><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>But first, let&rsquo;s Rewind ;). Rewind&rsquo;s
<a href=https://github.com/JensRantil/rewind/blob/develop/README.rst class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>README</a>
does a fairly good job at an elevator speech for <em>CQRS</em>:</p><blockquote><p>Have you ever been nervous of all those DBMSs schema changes when you
are deploying your applications? They are gonna take too long, or
break backward compatibility? Have you ever thought &ldquo;Crap, I wish I
had stored that information since earlier&rdquo;? Have you ever felt your
writing patterns and your reading patterns differ a lot, making things
harder to scale? Issues like these can be solved using <em>CQRS</em> and
<em>event sourcing</em>.</p><p><em>CQRS</em> (Command-Query Response Segregation) is an architectural
pattern that aims to solve these issues by splitting up your
architectural system into two parts:</p><ul><li>A <em>write side</em> that takes care of validating input and optimizes
for fast writes. The write side takes commands and outputs
corresponding events if the command validates correctly.</li><li>A <em>read side</em> that listens to incoming events from the write side.
The read side is optimized for fast reads and incrementally build
up state that can be queried fast.</li></ul><p>While not required, it is common to use messaging between the write
and read sides. This means that the system will be in an inconsistent
state from time to time. This is usually not an issue and came be
overcome in various ways.</p></blockquote><p>A couple of additional things to note about CQRS:</p><ul><li>As I see it, it is the architectural equivalent of the CQS design
pattern.</li><li>It is a pattern that decouples systems very well. This can have huge
implications when it comes to testability.</li><li>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that there are some similarities between
Domain Driven Design
(<a href=http://www.wikipedia.org/Domain-driven_design class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>DDD</a>) and CQRS.
Most vocabularies in DDD are used in CQRS; ubiquous language,
aggregates, aggregrate root, value objects, bounded contexts etc.</li></ul><p>The README then states about <em>Event Sourcing</em>:</p><blockquote><p>A common pattern used together with CQRS is <em>event sourcing</em>. The
concept can be summarized as using state changes as primary
persistence, instead of the final state. The state changes are called
<em>events</em> and they are generated by the write side and delivered to the
read side.</p><p>The events are persisted in an event store that sits inbetween the
read and write side of things. It takes care of three things:</p><ul><li>persisting all events to disk.</li><li>being a hub/broker replicating all events from the write to the
read side of things.</li><li>allowind fast querying of events so that different parts of the
system can be synced back on track and new components can be
brought back in play.</li></ul></blockquote><h2 id=rewind>Rewind
<a class=heading-link href=#rewind><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Question was, how would a CQRS/event sourced system behave in
production? Could it scale out? Could writes be partitioned? What about
fault tolerance? I was tired of heavy database schema changes, I wanted
a nouvaeu way of testing and question some of the common practices.</p><p>Enter <a href=http://www.github.com/JensRantil/rewind class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Rewind</a>; Rewind was my
pet project for a <a href=https://github.com/JensRantil/rewind/graphs/commit-activity class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>major part of
2012</a>. It
was <em>a Python implementation of an event store that supported multiple
backends</em>. It really gave me an opportunity to try everything I wanted.</p><p>The development of Rewind halted at the beginning of 2013. From thereon,
I instead used the lessons I had learnt and rewrote Rewind&rsquo;s
functionality in <a href=http://www.golang.org class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Go</a>. The project was named
<a href=https://www.github.com/JensRantil/gorewind class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>GoRewind</a>.</p><p>Within the next couple of blog posts I plan to write about what I&rsquo;ve
learnt from these two projects; design decisions, testability, ZeroMQ,
developing in Go among other things.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
