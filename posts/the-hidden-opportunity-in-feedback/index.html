feedback &ndash; mainly the discussion that happens afterwards. A classical way to
give feedback is using the <em>observed-perceived</em> method:</p><ol><li>Describe the <em>observed behavior</em> from your point of view. Do it as soon as
possible about the specific behavior that occurs.</li><li>Describe the <em>perceived impact</em> of the observed behavior.</li></ol><p>Unfortunately, what commonly follows is that the receiver of the feedback
explains why the observed behavior was so &ndash; followed by ending the feedback
session. &ldquo;Thanks for your feedback, Jens! I did that because X, Y, & Z.&rdquo;, then
walking away thinking</p><blockquote><p>Ah, well, that was just a misunderstanding. I have now explained myself and
we have now resolved the issue.</p></blockquote><p>I call this <em>feedback myopia</em>. &ldquo;Myopia&rdquo; is a term often used in optometry to
describe nearsightedness, which is a condition where one struggles to see
objects that are far away. However, in a metaphorical or symbolic context, like
in the suggestion &ldquo;Feedback Myopia&rdquo;, it refers to a lack of foresight or
discernment, a failure to think about long-term consequences or consider the
bigger picture. In this case, it suggests that someone is short-sighted in
their response to feedback, focusing only on the immediate (or nearest)
implications rather than considering the broader, longer-term, or overarching
outcomes.</p><p>Largely, there are five problems with feedback myopia:</p><ul><li>The <strong>receiver</strong> of feedback<ul><li><strong>only addresses the symptom of the issue</strong>, but does nothing to make sure
that the misunderstanding doesn&rsquo;t happen again.</li><li>is <strong>not really considering doing things in a different way</strong>. They have
just assumed that it&rsquo;s a misunderstanding.</li><li>does not ask clarifying questions from the giver, <strong>risking to not fully
understand why the behaviour is perceived the way it is</strong>. Sometimes when
you get feedback, the underlying perceived impact is based on something
implicit. The person might be scared, worried, or reminded of a similar
situation from the past.</li><li><strong>misses an opportunity to engage the person giving the feedback</strong> in
coming up with a solution. After all, it&rsquo;s a giver who knows the best how
to avoid this perceived impact.</li></ul></li><li>the <strong>giver</strong> walks away thinking that they took the opportunity to give
feedback, but ended up <strong>feeling just being <em>managed</em></strong>. I have particularly
had this feeling when I have given feedback to certain managers or C-levels
at previous jobs.</li></ul><p>At worst, feedback myopia can look like a weak form of
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>gaslightning</a> where the receiver explains that what the person
perceived is not what the person perceived.</p><p>The solution to this? Follow up the observed-perceived steps with a third step
&ndash; an open <strong>conversation</strong> focusing on avoiding the perceived impact:</p><p><em>As a receiver of feedback</em>, the questions you should ask yourself are:</p><ul><li>How can I avoid having this person give me similar feedback again? If I have
a solution to that, what does the giver think of that solution? Would they
think it would work?</li><li>Is there a way I can avoid the perceived impact without having to explain my
behavior to this person? If so, what does the giver think of that solution?
Would they think it would work?</li></ul><p>Undoubtedly, asking yourself these questions requires some amount of
self-distance and opening up for a different story.</p><p><em>As a giver of feedback</em>, you can help the conversation by not taking an
explanation for an answer. Instead, you can lead the receiver into a
self-reflection and forward-looking answer:</p><blockquote><p>That makes sense. How can we make sure that we avoid this misunderstanding in
the future? Is there anything else we could do to avoid this perceived impact
in the future?</p></blockquote><p>People tend to talk about &ldquo;feedback as a gift&rdquo;. The problem with a gift is that
there is no discussion after receiving it. I think that analogy sometimes does
us a disservice. For me, feedback is the start of a curious, forward-looking,
conversation.</p><p>So next time you are engaged in feedback, don&rsquo;t forget the conversation! That&rsquo;s
where the gold lies.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
