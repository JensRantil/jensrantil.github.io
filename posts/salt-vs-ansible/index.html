heard opinions from someone I respect that
<a href=http://puppetlabs.com class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Puppet</a> and <a href=http://www.getchef.com class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Chef</a> were
complicated beasts to get up and running, and since I am a Python guy
I&rsquo;ve generally always kept an eye on <a href=http://www.ansible.com class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Ansible</a>
and <a href=http://www.saltstack.com class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Salt</a>. Ruby is so far not my thing, but
hey let&rsquo;s not start a flamewar about that!</p><p>Last year I got to spend a good 6 months working with Ansible for
provisioning of servers. I became very familiar with the tool. In that
project, Ansible was mostly chosen because it was easy to get started
and had good documentation. The team I was working with was especially
fond of the <a href=http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_best_practices.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Best
Practises</a>
documentation which got us started quickly and taught us what structure
had worked previously.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago I went on a 10-day vacation in Japan, and for
those who don&rsquo;t know me that usually equals me spending a fair amount of
time of reading computer literature or documentation! Inbetween great
sushi, Tokyo skylines, amazing skiing and a rough flue I found <a href=https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/salt/latest/salt.pdf class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>the Salt
PDF-documentation</a>
to be great leisure!</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also spent some time getting a small Salt setup up and running with
their
<a href=http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/tutorials/starting_states.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>States</a>
system. Since I now feel like I have a pretty robust background in both
systems, I feel obliged to make a highly opinionated comparison. Let&rsquo;s
go:</p><h2 id=terminology>Terminology
<a class=heading-link href=#terminology><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Both Salt and Ansible are originally built as execution engines. That
is, they allow executing commands on one or more remote systems, in
parallel if you want.</p><p>Ansible supports executing arbitrary command line commands on multiple
machines. It also supports executing <em>modules</em>. An <a href=http://docs.ansible.com/modules.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Ansible
module</a> is basically a Python
module written in a certain Ansible friendly way. Most standard Ansible
modules are idempotent. This means you tell them the state you&rsquo;d want
your system to be in, and the module tries to make the system look like
that.</p><p>Ansible also has the concept of a
<a href=http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Playbook</a>. A playbook is a file
that defines a series of module executions for a set of hosts. A
playbook can vary the hosts modules are executed on. This makes it
possible to orchestrate multiple machines, such as take them out of a
load balancers before upgrading an application.</p><p>Salt has two types of modules; <a href=http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/modules/all/index.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>execution
modules</a> and
<a href=http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/states/all/index.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>state modules</a>.
Execution modules are modules simply executes something, it could be a
command line execution, or downloading a file. A state module is more
like an Ansible module, where the arguments define a state and the
module tries to fulfill that end state. In general state modules are
using execution modules to most of their work.</p><p>State modules are executed using the the <code>state</code> execution module. The
state module also supports defining states in files, called SLS files.
Which states to apply to which hosts is defined in a
<a href=http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/states/top.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>top.sls</a> file.</p><p>Both playbooks and SLS files (usually) are written in YAML.</p><p>As a side-note I want to point out the a remote execution engine is
highly useful for tasks such as doing inventory or kick off a certain
operation on multiple machines.</p><h3 id=architecture>Architecture
<a class=heading-link href=#architecture><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>Salt is built around a <em>Salt master</em> and multiple <em>Salt minions</em> that
are connecting to the master when they boot. Generally, commands are
issued on the master command line. The master then dispatches those
commands out to minions. Initially minions initiate a handshake
consisting of a cryptographic key exchange and after that they have a
persistent encrypted TCP connection. I could babble at length about how
they are using the <a href=http://zeromq.org class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>ZeroMQ</a> library for
communication, but let&rsquo;s just say that a Salt master can handle a
_lot_ of minions without being overloaded thanks to ZeroMQ.</p><p>Because minions have a persistent connection to Salt master commands are
fast to reach the minions. The minions also cache various data to make
execution faster.</p><p>Ansible is masterless and it uses SSH as its primary communication
layer. This means it is slower, but being masterless might make it
slightly easier to run setup and test Ansible playbooks. Some claim it&rsquo;s
also more secure because it doesn&rsquo;t require another server application.
Read more about that under &ldquo;Security&rdquo; further down.</p><p>Ansible does support a ZeroMQ version, but it requires an initial SSH
connection to setup. I tried it, and to be honest I didn&rsquo;t see that much
of a speedup. I guess bigger improvements can be seen for larger
playbooks and more hosts.</p><p>To keep track of machines Ansible recommends you have an <em>inventory</em>
file that basically contains a list of hosts, grouped by groups,
possibly with attributes added to either a group or a single host. You
can have multiple inventory files, say, one for staging and one for
production.</p><p>Salt also supports using SSH instead of ZeroMQ using <a href=http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/ssh/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Salt
SSH</a>. But beware, it&rsquo;s alpha
software (and I haven&rsquo;t tried it)&mldr;</p><h3 id=community>Community
<a class=heading-link href=#community><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>For both projects I&rsquo;ve had inquiries both on IRC and on mailing list.
I&rsquo;ve also contributed patches to them both - Python code and
documentation patches. Here&rsquo;s a summary of my experience:</p><p>Ansible: Quick friendly response on IRC. The rest of the project seems
to be less of a community effort and more a one-man-show lead by Michael
DeHaan. I&rsquo;m sorry to say, but I enjoy communities that are more open to
improvements and has a friendlier tone. Ansible improvement issues are
closed before fixed, which I feel like is hiding issues under the rug.
Good news all inquiries has been getting a response.</p><p>Salt has so far proven to be a more welcoming community. IRC responses
has mostly been quick and friendly. Sometimes I&rsquo;ve had to resort to the
mailing list. I&rsquo;ve had a couple of mailing list issues that has taken
~4 days to get a response on, but it seems like most threads will get a
follow-up response eventually.</p><p>My clear impression is that Salt has a more mature community in terms of
tone, welcomeness and collaboration. I&rsquo;m probably stepping on a lot of
people&rsquo;s toes saying this, but hey - this is an oppinionated review!</p><h2 id=speed>Speed
<a class=heading-link href=#speed><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>While you might think that speed is not important when you have a few
servers, I believe you are wrong. Being able to iterate fast is always
important. Period. A slow startup slows you down. If something takes
more than 30 seconds to compile I end up on Twitter, which means
compiling just took 120 seconds. It&rsquo;s the same with deployment.</p><p>Ansible is always using SSH for initiating connections. This is slow.
Its ZeroMQ implementation (mentioned earlier) does help, but
initialization is still slow. Salt uses ZeroMQ by default, and it is
_fast_.</p><p>Like said earlier, Salt has a permanent minion processes. This enables
Salt to cache files for faster reexecution of things.</p><h2 id=code-structure>Code structure
<a class=heading-link href=#code-structure><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>My biggest pet peeve with Ansible modules is that they can&rsquo;t be imported
(because they are <a href=https://github.com/JensRantil/ansible/blob/devel/library/files/copy#L189 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>executing code on
import</a>).
This means there&rsquo;s some magic involved when testing modules because you
can&rsquo;t import a module like any other. I don&rsquo;t like magic. I prefer pure
simple code. This is more of the Salt style.</p><p>Using less magic also means that it is more clear how to write test
suites for Salt modules. Salt is thouroughly tested. It also made me
happy to see that Salt comes with a
<a href=http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/development/tests/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>three</a>
<a href=http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/tests/integration.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>chapters</a> on
<a href=http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/development/tests/unit.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>testing</a>,
including the fact that they encourage mocking to enable testing of
infrastructure if you don&rsquo;t have, say, a MySQL instance.</p><p>The above said, Ansible has a pretty clean code in general. I managed to
navigate it pretty quickly. However, <a href=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ansible-project/mpRFULSiIQw/jIIQdOSubnUJ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>improving code
structure</a>
was clearly not of interest to the &ldquo;community&rdquo;.</p><p>Both Ansible and Salt have regular installables
<a href=https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ansible class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>via</a>
<a href=https://pypi.python.org/pypi/salt class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>PyPi</a>.</p><h2 id=vagrant>Vagrant
<a class=heading-link href=#vagrant><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>While talking about testing&mldr; DevOps people loves Vagrant. Until
recently I had not worked with it. Vagrant comes with provisioning
modules both for Salt and Ansible. This makes it a breeze to get up and
running with a master+minion in Vagrant, or executing a playbook on
startup.</p><h2 id=orchestration>Orchestration
<a class=heading-link href=#orchestration><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Both Ansible and Salt supports orchestration. I&rsquo;d say orchestration
rules generally are easier to get an overview of in Ansible. Basically,
a playbook is split up in groups of tasks, where each group matches to a
set of hosts (or a hostgroup). Each group is executed chronologically
according to order. The same comes for the executions order of tasks.</p><p>Salt supports
<a href=http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/event/index.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>events</a> and
<a href=http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/reactor/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>reactors</a> to those events.
This means a Salt execution can trigger things on another machine.
Salt&rsquo;s execution engine also enables things such as monitoring and it&rsquo;s
going to be really interesting to see what comes of that in the future.
For basic orchestration you can also use
<a href=http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/states/overstate.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Overstate</a> to set
up various roles in a cluster in a special order.</p><p>Ansible wins here because of its simplicity. Salt wins in features
because of it being able to react continuously to cluster changes.</p><p>Both Salt and Ansible also supports executing tasks over a window of
machines. This is useful to make sure a service is always available
through for example an upgrade.</p><h2 id=security>Security
<a class=heading-link href=#security><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Ansible uses SSH for transport. SSH is a battle tested protocol. As long
as the SSH server is correctly configured (with a good random number
generator), I believe most people would assume an SSH client is secure.</p><p>Ansible can also easily connect as multiple non-root users to a single
host. If you are extremelly picky about having processes running as
<code>root</code> you should evaluate Ansible. That said, Ansible supports using
<code>sudo</code> to execute its modules as <code>root</code>. If you don&rsquo;t want to connect
over SSH as <code>root</code>, that is.</p><p>Salt uses its &ldquo;own&rdquo; AES implementation and key handling. By &ldquo;own&rdquo; I want
to make a point out that it uses the
<a href=https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>PyCrypto</a> package for this.
There
<a href=http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-12943/product_id-26420/version_id-155046/Saltstack-Salt-0.17.0.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>has</a>
been security issues with Salt, but at the same time I think the
architecture is so simple that security is fairly easy to maintain.</p><p>What&rsquo;s also important to note is that Salt runs its master and minions
as <code>root</code> by default. This can be changed, but obviously it can be hard
to install Debian packages etc. if you are not root. As for the master,
you can configure it to allow the <code>salt</code> command as non-root. I highly
recommend that.</p><h3 id=sensitive-data>Sensitive data
<a class=heading-link href=#sensitive-data><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>All sensitive data being rolled out will at some point need to reside on
the provisioning machine. If the provisioning machine is a sysadmin&rsquo;s
machine, which nowadays usually are laptops, you risk having that data
stolen.</p><p>After deep and long thinking about this I believe the authoritarian
master approach is a better one. This means sensitive data can be
enforced to only reside on one locked down place (with encrypted
backups, of course). Salt lets you store security credentials in
&ldquo;Pillars&rdquo;. Sure, a master intrusion would be devastating, but you only
need to secure one machine. Not all developer machines in cafés, on
trains and airports.</p><p>Obviously, Ansible users do have the option to always execute their
playbooks from a secured machine that holds the sensitive data. But is
this what people do?</p><h3 id=auditability>Auditability
<a class=heading-link href=#auditability><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>When talking about security I also think auditability is important.
Here, Salt wins big. Every execution Salt does is
<a href=http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/jobs/index.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>stored</a> for X number
of days on the master. This makes it easy to both debug, but also see if
there&rsquo;s been anything fishy going on.</p><h2 id=deployment>Deployment
<a class=heading-link href=#deployment><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Ansible is definitely easier here. No deployment is needed. Sure, Salt
supports SSH but the documentation mostly assumes ZeroMQ. But hey, SSH
is slow anyway&mldr;</p><p>A nice thing about provisioning minions is that they are the ones
connecting to the master. This makes it quick and easy to bootstrap a
bunch of new machines quickly. The minion-connects architecture is also
useful if you&rsquo;d like to use something like Amazon&rsquo;s autoscaling
features. Each autoscaled instance will automatically become a minion.</p><p>The Salt <a href=https://github.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>bootstrap script</a>
is incredibly useful for bootstrapping and makes it a breeze. It handles
a bunch of different distributions and is <a href=http://salt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/tutorials/salt_bootstrap.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>well
documented</a>.</p><h2 id=learning-curve>Learning curve
<a class=heading-link href=#learning-curve><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Ansible wins here. It&rsquo;s easier to get started and comprehend. Mostly
because nothing else is needed than cloning the Ansible GIT repo,
setting a couple of environment variables and starting to execute your
playbooks.</p><p>Salt can run in <a href=http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/tutorials/quickstart.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>masterless
mode</a>. This
makes it easier to get it up and running. However, for production (and
stability) I recommend getting an actual master up and running.</p><p>Generally, Salt comes with more bells and whistles but the cost is that
the learning curve is steeper. Salt is <a href=http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/development/modular_systems.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>highly
modular</a>.
This is great in terms of code structure but requires more parts to be
understood to fully grok Salt.</p><h2 id=upgrading>Upgrading
<a class=heading-link href=#upgrading><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Upgrading Salt depends on how it was installed. For Debian based
distributions there is an <code>apt</code> repository holding the latest Debian
packages. So upgrading is simply <code>apt-get upgrade</code>. For Ubuntu, there is
a PPA. Both repositories are actively maintained. The latest <code>2014.1.0</code>
release that came out recently had its Debian/Ubuntu packages packaged
within a week (and that was long!).</p><p>Upgrading Ansible is even simpler; You simply execute
<code>git fetch && git checkout &lt;tag></code>. That&rsquo;s it.</p><h2 id=documentation>Documentation
<a class=heading-link href=#documentation><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>As of documentation, both projects have all information you need to get
up and running, developing modules and configure setups. Ansible has
historically had a better structure of its documentation than Salt. That
said, there has been
<a href=https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/10526 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>great</a>
<a href=https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/10792 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>effort</a> to structure the
Salt documentation recently. I contributed a lot of issues to that goal
and most of them have been fixed.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion
<a class=heading-link href=#conclusion><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>To me, Ansible was a great introduction to automated server
configuration and deployment. It was easy to get up and running and has
great documentation.</p><p>Moving forward, the scalability, speed and architecture of Salt has it
going for it. For cloud deployments I find the Salt architecture to be a
better fit. I would not hesitate to use Salt in the future.</p><p>All this said, you should give both projects a spin before making your
decision. They&rsquo;re fairly quick to set up and test.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
