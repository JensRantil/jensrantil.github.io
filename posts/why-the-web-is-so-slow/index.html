slow? by
Stoyan Stefanov. This gave me the idea to give
some common reasons for the web to be slow. I&rsquo;ve been using &ldquo;web
application&rdquo; fairly sloppy here. It could also mean &ldquo;website&rdquo; etc. Here
they are:

Because of actual distance from your computer to the webserver. The
upper limit is the speed of light. This means that it is an
impossibility for information to travel from Sydney to London in
less than ~0.056 seconds (17009 kilometers).
Fetching a webpage requires a roundtrip of information; a request
and response. This effectively nearly doubles the time to
fetch something.
Websites generally has a bunch of static files (images,
javascript, CSS). The web browser has a
limit
on the number of files that can be fetched in parallel. Similar
images can be assembled into
sprites, JavaScript and CSS
can be combined and compressed.
The HTTP
protocol
does not support a single connection fetching multiple static assets
in parallel.
SSL requires a longer complicated handshake and extra CPU when
sending and receiving data.
Because of unnecessary synchronicity in dynamic applications.
Historically it&rsquo;s been possible for developers to only update the
portions of a website that needs update. However, the tools have not
really been up to speed. This has changed. Many modern JavaScript
frameworks has created new opportunities here. Yes, I&rsquo;m thinking of
you AngularJS.
Because of sloppy considerations of caching. Getting up to speed
with a web application is pretty easy. Getting HTTP caching right
requires some thought.
Because many web applications have not migrated to use a
CDN. If we
come together and all use CDNs, our visitors would be way more
likely to have the common static files cached.
Because of complex rendering of websites. The implications of
complex HTML structure and CSS selectors is that rendering of a
website is slow. KISS = Keep It Simple, Stupid.
Because many web servers today are still not delivering compressed
HTTP responses, such as GZip.
Because many webdevelopers don&rsquo;t understand the implications of
using slow third party assets. Yes, I&rsquo;m looking at you Analytics and
Ad Companies! Slow assets gives website visitors the feeling that
the website is not done loading when 99% of the assets really are.
Because many webdevelopers still are using JavaScript when they
don&rsquo;t have to. CSS3 can animate and allow for simple logic
without JavaScript.
Because we are sending cookies for a lot of content that does not
require cookes.
Because HTML is larger that it needs to be. Reusing CSS classes
reduces the size of HTML to be fetched.
Because images are sent when they really could be emulated
using CSS. This is a thing of the past that still bugs me.

Google&rsquo;s networking protocol SPDY
aims to solve some of these issues and make the web faster."><meta name=keywords content="blog,developer,staff engineering,personal"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Why the Web is so Slow"><meta name=twitter:description content="I just read the blog post Why is the web so slow? by Stoyan Stefanov.
