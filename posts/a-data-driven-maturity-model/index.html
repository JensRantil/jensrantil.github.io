Strategy</a>. It reminded me that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to share
some of my own learnings and thoughts when it comes to data-driven teams:</p><p>I was part of a big push to introduce service levels at my previous job. The
objective of the project was to make our company data-driven when it came to
operational excellence. A thing I kept seeing was that many people saw the
project as a <em>technical</em> project; gathering metrics, creating tooling for
defining SLIs/SLOs & dashboards, etc. We did all of that work, but still the
project did not succeed. Why? I kept reminding people that</p><blockquote><p>Success for this project is when every team looks at their Service Levels
dashboard(s) at least once per week and act on them.</p></blockquote><p>It turns out that when it comes to making a team data-driven (KPIs,
Observability, Service Levels&mldr;), having all the collection and tooling in
place is <em>not</em> the end goal. <strong>The end goal is for people to use data
regularly and <em>have data guide their decisions</em>.</strong> From this perspective,
getting the technical foundation in place is easy. But <a href=https://blog.glyph.im/2024/02/let-me-tell-you-a-secret.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>changing the
behavior</a> of people is the more important, and harder,
problem to solve.</p><p>Based on what I have seen, I think a team&rsquo;s journey to become more data-driven
loosely follows this path:</p><ol><li><strong>Collection.</strong> (technical) Gathering data.</li><li><strong>Query tooling in place.</strong> (technical) Having tools in place to execute
one-off queries.</li><li><strong>Ad-hoc queries for deeper understanding.</strong> (behavioral) Teams are now
executing one-off queries to understand how something works in detail.
This makes them answer specific questions they might have.</li><li><strong>Some project(s) have clearly defined targets.</strong> (behavioral) For certain
projects where it is easy to measure an outcome, &ldquo;current status&rdquo;, (where we
are today, ie. 10% drop in user signup) & &ldquo;target goal&rdquo; (where we expect to
end up, ie. reduce user signup drops by 20%) is documented. However, at
this stage, the team never goes back to see if they hit the target.</li><li><strong>Some project(s) are looped back during the finish line to check if they met
the target.</strong> (behavioral) Same as above, but for certain projects, the
team goes back to the initial target and checks whether the target was met
or not.</li><li><strong>Dashboards in place.</strong> (technical) Dashboards are generally a
prerequisite to standardize on certain metrics. Until now, metrics are
queried for ad-hoc and are not as easily accessible.</li><li><strong>Regularly looking at metrics.</strong> (behavioral) This is where there are
rituals in place to look at data regularly. Teams learn things but
generally don&rsquo;t act on them. Dashboards are almost a prerequisite for this.</li><li><strong>Regularly adjusting for missing data & metrics.</strong> (behavioural &
technical) Certain teams get stuck looking at predefined dashboards. A
common fallacy is to have a centralized platform team define metrics for
all teams. A true metrics-driven team creates metrics tailored to <em>its</em>
problems & domain.</li><li><strong>Regularly acting & course-correcting based on metrics.</strong> (behavioural)
This is where a team not only learns new things but regularly asks
themselves &ldquo;Do we need to act on this metric?&rdquo;. This also includes tracking
the progress of projects through data.</li><li><strong>Most or all projects are naturally data-driven.</strong> (behavioral) Most
projects now have clear &ldquo;current status&rdquo; and &ldquo;target goal&rdquo;. Tracking
the progress of projects by comparing them to their target is a natural part of
executing a project. Once those projects are delivered, you use data to
verify the project delivered according to the initial target set out.
Finally, data is used to understand & learn from why a failed project did
not succeed.</li></ol><p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that all the technical-only steps above <em>don&rsquo;t add any
value</em>. The steps that actually <em>do</em> add value are the behavioral changes. As
such, I have come up with a Metric Maturity model that so far seems to apply
pretty well:</p><ol><li><strong>Ad-hoc queries for deeper understanding.</strong></li><li><strong>Some project(s) have clearly defined targets.</strong></li><li><strong>Some project(s) are looped back during the finish line to check if they
met the target.</strong></li><li><strong>Regularly looking at metrics.</strong></li><li><strong>Regularly adjusting for missing data & metrics.</strong></li><li><strong>Regularly acting & course-correcting based on metrics.</strong></li><li><strong>Most or all projects are naturally data-driven.</strong></li></ol><p>If you want your team to improve on their Service Levels, Observability, KPI
journey, I highly recommend asking yourself where you are in this maturity
model and how to take your team to the next level.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
