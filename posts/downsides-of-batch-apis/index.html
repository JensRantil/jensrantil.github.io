immediately turn to making the API <em>do more in one unit of work</em>. I think this
pattern can be very harmful and have many battle scars from this. So I thought
I would write a post about it.</p><h2 id=an-example>An example
<a class=heading-link href=#an-example><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Let&rsquo;s start with an example: You have a web service that stores TODO items. It
has an API endpoint, <code>POST /todo</code>, which gets called to add a new TODO item.
Here is an example request/response:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>POST /todo
{text: &#34;Do laundry&#34;, &#34;completed&#34;: false}

200
{&#34;msg&#34;: &#34;Saved TODO!&#34;}
</code></pre><p>(300 ms)</p><h2 id=a-throughput-bottleneck-enters-the-stage>A throughput bottleneck enters the stage
<a class=heading-link href=#a-throughput-bottleneck-enters-the-stage><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>The API works great until your TODO service has turned into a hugely successful
TODO SaaS which allows users to import their TODOs from their previous TODO
platforms. With the click of a button, we now want users to be able to import
10,000 TODOs from the competitor. The immediate problem? Importing them would take</p><pre><code>10,000x300ms = 3,000,000 ms = 3,000 seconds = 50 minutes
</code></pre><p>. 50 minutes is a long time!</p><h2 id=the-batching-solution>The batching solution
<a class=heading-link href=#the-batching-solution><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>The go-to solution by many is to modify the API endpoint above (or
introduce a new &ldquo;ingest API endpoint&rdquo;) such that it has a larger unit of work.
In this case, we modify it to take a <em>list</em> of TODOs instead:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>POST /todo
[
    {&#34;text&#34;: &#34;Do laundry&#34;, &#34;completed&#34;: true},
    {&#34;text&#34;: &#34;Fix flat tire&#34;, &#34;completed&#34;: true},
    {&#34;text&#34;: &#34;Write that love letter to Rita&#34;, &#34;completed&#34;: true},
    {&#34;text&#34;: &#34;Call my best buddy Brad&#34;, &#34;completed&#34;: true},
    {&#34;text&#34;: &#34;Do the dishes&#34;, &#34;completed&#34;: true}
]

200
{&#34;msg&#34;: &#34;Saved 5 TODOs!&#34;}
</code></pre><p>(500 ms)</p><p>The assumption here is that the API roundtrip is the problem - so doing a
single API roundtrip (and usually a single roundtrip to the underlying
database), we sped up the API endpoint a <em>lot</em>.</p><p>At a glance, this solves the problem in a seemingly simple way! Suddenly we
have one roundtrip to the API instead of 10k. Sure, the time takes a little
longer, but that&rsquo;s expected since we <em>are</em> storing more activities than a
single.</p><h2 id=the-costs>The Costs
<a class=heading-link href=#the-costs><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>However, contrary to common beliefs, the above-described solution has many
hidden downsides that incur future implementation, maintenance, and operational
costs:</p><p><strong>Validation semantics complexity</strong> (implementation). Every time you make an
API call and validation fails, you likely need to start returning a <em>list</em> of
validation errors including <em>which</em> (list index) item failed validation and
how. This turns into one additional thing the API caller must handle.</p><p><strong>Atomicity confusion</strong> (implementation). The API caller will need to
read the documentation (if there is some!) to see what happens if <em>one</em> of the
TODOs aren&rsquo;t passing validation. Is it storing all other TODOs? Or are none of
them stored?</p><p><strong>Debuggability and understandability</strong> (maintenance). Generally, if something
goes wrong (weird HTTP response code returned), the caller will spend a
significant amount of time trying to figure out <em>which</em> of the TODOs, if any,
was faulty. Mapping a single TODO to a single API call makes debuggability and
understandability much easier.</p><p><strong>Code complexity</strong> (maintenance). This is a minor one, but from now on we need
to iterate over a list of TODOs in our API endpoint source code everywhere;
validation, storing, logging, counting, etc.</p><p><strong>Memory/CPU bottlenecks</strong> (operational). There is a risk that you have some
user who decides to import 100 million TODOs. Suddenly, your application runs
out of memory and starts crashing - impacting your other users. You can of
course set upper limits on request body size and/or number of TODOs (best
practice!). Now you need to incur the cost of maintaining documentation of that
limit&mldr;</p><p><strong>Worse observability</strong> (operational). Your latency metrics can&rsquo;t be trusted as
much anymore. A key thing when working with performance is to reduce the
variability/variance of API call latencies. Without that, you will not be able
to trust your latency metrics. With the batching solution above, you will have
no idea if latencies spiked because your service was overloaded - or someone
simply decided to import 1 million TODOs in one giant API call.</p><p>At <code>$previousJob</code>, I had to bucket my latency metrics by list size to get a
better feel for whether our systems were having issues, or users simply
submitted larger units of work. Unnecessary complexity!</p><p><strong>Horisontal scalability issues (operational).</strong> The idea with horizontal
scalability is that you can throw more machines/service instances at a problem
to increase throughput. Generally one uses a load balancer for this. If you are
working with large requests, the work will not be spread evenly.</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC0DARpayhw" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Even distribution of load</a>, particularly for uneven unit of
work is a classically <em>hard</em> distributed systems engineering problem - let&rsquo;s
not go there&mldr;)</p><p><strong>Limit creep</strong> (maintenance). Strictly this isn&rsquo;t a problem (and possibly this
is <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>slippery slope</a>), but I can&rsquo;t help to mention that once
you&rsquo;ve opened up the can of worms of working with list/request limits, there is
a strong risk you will simply start bumping the limit over and over again until
the above issues grow in magnitude. You are essentially shooting yourself in
the foot slowly over time. Saying no to batching from the start is one way to
avoid this.</p><p><strong>Virality of batching</strong> (maintenance & operational). Finally, what I have
observed is that once you start doing a larger unit of work in your public API,
a larger unit of work also starts creeping into every corner of your backend
systems. Your API perimeter team will start asking all internal services to
support batching. Suddenly you have the above-mentioned issues all over your
backend and not just at the perimeter.</p><p><strong>Rate-limiting complexity (maintenance & operational).</strong> Rate-limiting is far
less useful for API endpoints if you do batching. This is because each API
call can either be a heavy (1000 items) or lightweight (1 item) one. If you
want to put rate-limiting in place for your batch API properly, you will need
custom rate-limiting based on the number of items being sent in each API call.
Now the question of atomicity comes into play - should certain items be stored
but not others? Do you <em>really</em> want the client to deal with that?</p><h2 id=an-alternative>An alternative
<a class=heading-link href=#an-alternative><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Really, the problem we have here is one of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>queueing theory</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Amdahl&rsquo;s
law</a>. There are two routes we can take to solve our slow ingestion:</p><ul><li><strong>Improve the unit of work.</strong> This is what we did above!</li><li><strong>Parallellize the work.</strong> This is what I am proposing to do below.</li></ul><p>The latter usually comes with none of the above costs and pushes complexity to
the calling client. Instead of making <em>one API call with 10k TODOs</em> we make
<em>10k API calls, each with a single TODO</em>.</p><p>There is a problem with the above, though; An API rarely supports 10k
concurrent API calls, particularly until it has scaled up (using auto-scaling,
which you have in place, right? 😉). There are ways to combat this:</p><ul><li><strong>Putting a limit on concurrent API calls in the client.</strong> A <a href=https://www.guru99.com/semaphore-in-operating-system.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>counting
semaphore</a> is one way of doing this. A group of threads/coroutines
popping from a queue is another.</li><li><strong>Making API calls <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>idempotent</a> and implement retries.</strong> Make a
timed out, or failed, request retried without having duplicates. Usually,
this is done by the client submitting the identifier of the TODO to avoid
duplicates. This has the added benefit of adding resiliency - if your
service has a general hiccup, this might save you big time!</li><li>Adding <strong>rate-limiting</strong> to the server to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t get
overwhelmed by many API calls.</li></ul><h2 id=when-is-batching-a-good-idea-then>When is batching a good idea, then?
<a class=heading-link href=#when-is-batching-a-good-idea-then><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Batching <em>can</em> be useful if you want to make sure that all TODOs are
added <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_%28database_systems%29 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>atomically</a>. I.e. &ldquo;either zero or all TODOs were added&rdquo;.</p><p>However, there is a way to do this in a different way by using a transactions
API similar to database transactions:</p><ol><li><code>POST /todo/start?transactionId=abc123</code></li><li><code>POST /todo?transactionId=abc123</code></li><li><code>POST /todo?transactionId=abc123</code></li><li>&mldr;</li><li><code>POST /todo?transactionId=abc123</code></li><li><code>POST /todo/end?transactionId=abc123</code></li></ol><p>This does not avoid <em>all</em> problems above, but some. But I would first start
challenging the requirement if atomicity is truly needed and worth it&mldr;</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
