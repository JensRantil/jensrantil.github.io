5-minute read</span></div></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Earlier this year, I was on a complex multi-team project that was handed to us by our product organization. The project had a lot of dependencies between teams and could have been a disaster. Today I would like to share an approach we took to structure the project into what eventually made it a success.</p><p>The project was to deliver a new product feature, and the deadline was three months in the future. About 15 engineers were involved in this project, and close to no product owner was included in the project group to guide us.</p><p>Our first week was a mess. It was somewhat unclear who was running the project, and worse, we lacked common ground on how to approach it. Someone proposed that we would create (virtual) Post-it notes on our (online) whiteboard, one Post-it for every task needed to finish the project. Suddenly, the board was filled with many unstructured tasks. But how would we approach implementing them?</p><p>As someone who has seen large-scale engineering efforts fail miserably, I was getting worried. I noticed that some people seemed contemptuous about their team&rsquo;s tasks. They signaled that now they knew exactly what they needed to build for the next 2,5 months and the teams would simply piece together things as we went along. Others, like me, were worried that we would end up with a failed waterfall project. Quick feedback on delivery was lacking, and were were <a href=https://agilemanifesto.org class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>following a plan over responding to change</a>.</p><h2 id=breaking-down-the-work>Breaking down the work
<a class=heading-link href=#breaking-down-the-work><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>One good thing was that the group accepted my idea to have a meeting every Monday to talk about how the project was moving along. Quick feedback, ftw! The following Monday, I asked to lead the meeting. It was done out of frustration, but few knew, I suppose. :)</p><p>My first step was to draw up a table where I asked the group to summarize what we were trying to achieve at the end of the quarter. While this might seem obvious at first glance, you might be surprised by the different answers you get when there are 15 people involved! After some conversation, we agreed to a common statement. Our whiteboard now looked something like this:</p><figure><img src=/posts/large-project-breakup/1.svg alt="Kanban board with columns labeled End-to-end delivery, Team 1, Team 2, and continuing up to Team N. A yellow sticky note is in the End-to-end delivery column, representing E2E product delivery (aka 'Stories'), as explained in a legend on the right. The board tracks the progress of a product through various teams."><figcaption><p>Kanban board tracking end-to-end delivery across multiple teams. Currently only containing our end-of-quarter delivery.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I then continued and asked everyone to write down all the tasks they thought their team would need to finish to reach our goal. I knew we needed to break these down into smaller, incremental deliveries, but I also knew that there were forces that did not have an agile mindset. If we did not write down <em>everything</em> that needed to be done, they would feel uncomfortable and not in control. We used a different color for tasks, and this is what the board looked like after this step:</p><figure><img src=/posts/large-project-breakup/2.svg alt="Diagram showing an end-to-end delivery workflow across multiple teams. The 'End-to-end delivery' column on the left contains a yellow box labeled 'E2E product delivery (aka Stories).' Each team (Team 1, Team 2, up to Team N) has green boxes representing 'Tasks' associated with the product delivery. Teams work in parallel on different tasks related to the overall end-to-end delivery."><figcaption><p>Diagram containing our end-of-quarter delivery and an unstructured list of all tasks the teams thought they needed to do.</p></figcaption></figure><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of tasks!&rdquo;, I said. &ldquo;I think we need to add some structure to this. How about we add arrows between tasks that we know depend on each other? Let&rsquo;s also move, tasks needed to be done earlier higher up and tasks done later further down.&rdquo;. People nodded and once again engaged in the Miro board. The outcome looked something like this:</p><figure><img src=/posts/large-project-breakup/3.svg alt="Diagram illustrating an end-to-end delivery process across multiple teams with dependencies. A yellow box labeled 'E2E product delivery (aka Stories)' is shown in the 'End-to-end delivery' column. Green boxes in each team column (Team 1, Team 2, up to Team N) represent 'Tasks.' Arrows between tasks indicate dependencies."><figcaption><p>Diagram of the end-of-quarter delivery with task dependencies across multiple teams.</p></figcaption></figure><p>At this point, I suggested to build a really small end-to-end implementation by the end of the week. Something that we could show to product owners and managers<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>.</p><p>Multiple group members came up with a few different candidates for end-to-end implementations and we realized they actually had dependencies between themselves. Great! This naturally showed us which end-to-end delivery we would start with!</p><p>I made three changes to our whiteboard:</p><ol><li>Added all the end-to-end candidates with dependency lines to the left-most &ldquo;End-to-end delivery&rdquo; column.</li><li>Split the table vertically into a crude chronological split: &ldquo;This week&rdquo; & &ldquo;Later&rdquo;.</li><li>Moved our top-pick end-to-end delivery into &ldquo;This week&rdquo;.</li></ol><p>Our whiteboard now looked like this:</p><figure><img src=/posts/large-project-breakup/4.svg alt="Diagram illustrating an end-to-end delivery process across multiple teams with dependencies. Yellow boxes labeled 'E2E product delivery (aka Stories)' are shown in the 'End-to-end delivery' column. Green boxes in each team column (Team 1, Team 2, up to Team N) represent 'Tasks.' Arrows between tasks or E2E deliveries indicate dependencies."><figcaption><p>End-to-end delivery process with dependencies across multiple teams, including deliveries and tasks.</p></figcaption></figure><p>In our final step for our planning session, we moved all the tasks related to our first end-to-end implementation up into &ldquo;This week&rdquo;. This allowed everyone to see exactly the low-level tasks that needed to be implemented and how they depended on each other:</p><figure><img src=/posts/large-project-breakup/5.svg alt="Diagram illustrating an end-to-end delivery process across multiple teams with dependencies. Yellow boxes labeled 'E2E product delivery (aka Stories)' are shown in the 'End-to-end delivery' column. Green boxes in each team column (Team 1, Team 2, up to Team N) represent 'Tasks.' Arrows between tasks or E2E deliveries indicate dependencies. Tasks and deliveries are split up vertically into 'This week' and 'Later'."><figcaption><p>End-to-end delivery process with dependencies, organized by timeframe for tasks and deliveries.</p></figcaption></figure><p>This visualization was particularly useful in identifying bottlenecks early. Which team would likely block other teams? Could we somehow support that team with more engineers, or have another team implement something?</p><p>Once we had the above whiteboard board ready, we spent the rest of the week implementing and collaborating. Teams were themselves responsible for creating actual Jira/Linear tickets for each task. And, as Friday approached, we had something to show.</p><p>Every Monday, we revisited our board, and</p><ol><li>moved our done tasks and end-to-end deliveries up into &ldquo;Done&rdquo;.</li><li>moved a new end-to-end delivery and corresponding tasks up into &ldquo;This week&rdquo;.</li></ol><p>It looked something like this:</p><figure><img src=/posts/large-project-breakup/6.svg alt="Similar to the previous diagram, but now also with a 'Done' row for items that were wrapped up."><figcaption><p>End-to-end delivery process with dependencies and an added &lsquo;Done&rsquo; row for completed items.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found the &ldquo;Done&rdquo; row to be a great way to also celebrate all the work we had done as our quarter progressed.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion
<a class=heading-link href=#conclusion><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>I liked this approach of using a whiteboard over spending a lot of time in a ticketing system for planning. It was fun, pragmatic, and social. It also allowed us to visualize planning without overplanning.</p><p>By facilitating, I helped our working group to collaboratively structure the work we needed to do. By breaking down the work into smaller, weekly, end-to-end deliverables, we ended up showing the stakeholders our progress every week. We approached our project in an agile way, without me ever having to use the convoluted term &ldquo;Agile&rdquo;. The project was delivered successfully - on time.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>I deliberately avoided the word &ldquo;stakeholders&rdquo; to sound less businessy, be more inclusive, and more concrete.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
