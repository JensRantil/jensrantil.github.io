<a class=heading-link href=#the-problem><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>I was working at a startup and was the only engineer doing SRE &
operations-related work. This included things like setting sane limits, scaling
systems, provisioning servers, configuring AWS, CI/CD, as well as a mix of
various supporting infrastructure such as databases, monitoring & alerting
tools, and caches. At the time the startup consisted of a team of maybe 20
engineers or so.</p><p>For some time I thought I was doing great - I was shipping a ton of changes in
small increments across the stack and our infrastructure. We had Infrastructure
as a Code (IaaS) in place which allowed us to iterate quickly on things.
Whenever something was broken, I was on it! Whenever someone needed my
assistance, I was fixing it. My cycle time for fixing things was <em>short</em> and I
was proud to show our engineers how one could work truly in short cycles and
get a ton of Shit Done&#8482;&#xfe0f;. I was fixing business problems at amazing speed - I
thought I had reached a global optimum at work!</p><p>However, there were two problems I was beginning to see; I was a bottleneck,
and I was increasingly stressed:</p><p>&ldquo;Bottleneck?&rdquo;, you might think. I was definitely <em>not</em> a bottleneck when it
came to <em>cycle time</em> of tasks picked up. However, there was an increasing
realization that I was a <em>knowledge bottleneck</em>; Our engineering organization
did not know SRE practices and had very little operations knowledge. A lot of
work had to be done by me - either because I knew how it would be done, or
because it would be done faster.</p><p>Being a knowledge silo also meant that I was hindering the growth of other
engineers. The best engineers I have ever worked with are the ones who
understand the full software development life-cycle, including SRE practices
and operations work. I wanted to be an enabler for growth, but at the time I
didn&rsquo;t have all the tools in place for that to happen (more on that later).</p><p>As most engineers know, performance usually revolves around <em>throughput &
latency</em>. &ldquo;Cycle time&rdquo; is the latency of performing a task. On top of this, we
have <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Little&rsquo;s Law</a> that loosely states that &ldquo;throughput is
proportional to the number of actors doing some work in parallel&rdquo;. In the
context of our organization, my being a knowledge bottleneck meant that other
engineers could not do the work I was doing. This made me a <em>throughput
bottleneck</em>.</p><p>On top of this, being a knowledge bottleneck gave me a high <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>bus
factor</a>; The organization was not resilient to me being gone &ndash;
and, oh boy, did I feel it! I constantly had a bad conscience about being sick
or taking a day off from work. I felt stressed because of that. And I felt
stressed because I knew I <a href=https://xkcd.com/2347/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>had the entire company built on the stack I was
maintaining</a>.</p><p>All of these insights led me to conclude that I had been one-sidedly optimizing
for short-term cycle time. My sole focus on cycle time was not in the long-term
interest of me, my team, nor my company. Increasing throughput & resiliency of
losing me would have a great positive impact on my team and on the business. I
concluded I needed to make myself a True <a href=https://www.amazon.se/-/en/Tony-Chatman/dp/0998992704 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Force Multiplier</a>.</p><h2 id=the-solution-for-me>The solution for me
<a class=heading-link href=#the-solution-for-me><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>I am a teacher at heart. I love teaching. From day one at this startup, I did
so much knowledge sharing: I shared links in Slack & in code reviews, I took
the time to explain how things worked &ndash; and I did a fair amount of
presentations and some workshops. I shared everything from infrastructure
knowledge to how to write good code and unit tests. In fact, I think I was
doing all the teaching I could except one thing &ndash; taking a step back and
allowing other people to do the work I was doing.</p><p>It turns out, that most startups have a tendency to optimize for solving
short-term problems over the long term. Short-term means &ldquo;solving this one
particular problem X&rdquo; and it is easy to get caught in &ldquo;let&rsquo;s just have
Jim-the-expert fix that&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.inteqgroup.com/blog/transforming-a-hero-culture class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>hero culture</a>), or &ldquo;I will just fix
that much faster than anyone else&rdquo; (not really hero culture, but close).</p><p>Taking a step back to create space for others is <em>hard</em>. Not only due
to the short-term forces mentioned above but also because it can be hard for
one&rsquo;s ego (am still useful???).</p><p>For me, I was lucky and had a ticket out. Litteraly. As it turns out, I got the
opportunity to work for 6 weeks from another side of the globe. Adding a
12-hour latency to answer questions in Slack is an amazing way to encourage
colleagues to try out things themselves. Every morning I woke up I would see a
few &ldquo;Hello Jens - could you help me with X?&rdquo;, followed by &ldquo;Never mind! I
figured it out!&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=the-next-few-years>The next few years
<a class=heading-link href=#the-next-few-years><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>As opposed to what many people think, delegating to others what you are good at
doing is a very effective way to grow in your career and get promotions. It
sure was for me. Moving away from being a knowledge and throughput bottleneck
gave me a springboard to work on new exciting projects, many of them of my own
choosing. Eventually, it gave me a promotion to work as a Staff Engineer within
a 300-person engineering organization.</p><p>I have seen certain engineers get stuck doing what they are good at. I would
actually say that&rsquo;s a much bigger risk of losing your job in the long run than
moving on with new tasks, finding & solving new interesting problems, and
&ldquo;always be learning&rdquo;.</p><p>Eventually, I also discovered mob programming and have increasingly been doing
pair programming. By rotating who is coding, I have forced people with less
knowledge to do the work instead of me. It&rsquo;s a great way to share knowledge
and offload responsibilities from me.</p><p>Finally, by no longer putting myself in the spotlight I feel like I have
transitioned to be a true team member. I know it&rsquo;s cheesy, but there truly is
no longer an &ldquo;I&rdquo; in my teams.</p><h2 id=my-learnings>My learnings
<a class=heading-link href=#my-learnings><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>In short, I learned that</p><ul><li>optimizing for short-cycle time for performing tasks only is a short-term
solution.</li><li>even though you think you are not a bottleneck (for cycle time), you can
still be a bottleneck in terms of knowledge & throughput.</li><li>being a knowledge bottleneck means you are a throughput bottleneck.</li><li>moving out of being a knowledge silo can be <em>hard</em>.</li><li>optimising for a team is the most long-term sustainable thing to do for you,
for your team, and for your company. That usually involves focusing on
avoiding being in a knowledge silo.</li></ul><p>Now, what&rsquo;s the next thing you would like to stop doing - so you can work on
that next cool project, or make that career move, you&rsquo;ve always been dreaming
of?</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
