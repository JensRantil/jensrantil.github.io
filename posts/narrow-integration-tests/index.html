<a href=https://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationTest.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>article</a> on integration
tests so I&rsquo;ll simply refer to that for the details of what a narrow integration
test is.</p><p>That said, during 2019 I have grown increasingly convinced that the distinction
between a narrow and wide integration (also know as <em>system tests</em> or <em>end-to-end tests</em>) is an important one, for two reasons:</p><p>First, given that narrow integration tests depends on very few components the
<a href=https://jensrantil.github.io/posts/testing-strategy-over-time/>cost of maintenance is very low</a>. Compare this to wide
integration tests where cost of maintaining them increases with number of
components and/or software complexity.</p><p>Secondly, because I believe a large majority of the wide integration tests can
be replaced by a set of narrow integration tests. The benefit would be a more
maintainable test suite over time, with equal confidence that it catches bugs.
Let me explain:</p><p>A common counter-argument against unit and narrow integration testing is that
they don&rsquo;t test the application as a whole. In one way, this is true, but you
could also look at <em>a whole as an overlap of many smaller pieces</em>. For example,
a lot of software architecture models involves thinking in layers (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_%28software%29 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Hexagonal
architecture</a>,
<a href=https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Clean
architecture</a>
and more). So, let&rsquo;s imagine a very simple application that receives an HTTP
API call, does some business logic and stores something in a database:</p><p><a href=narrow-integration-tests.png><img src=/posts/narrow-integration-tests/narrow-integration-tests.png alt="Narrow integration tests"></a></p><p>An API call from the Internet flows through each layer of our application. With
input being validated and transformed as it passes through layers towards
persistence, and result/output from the final persistence eventually trickling
back to the API caller.</p><p>A growing hypothesis of mine is that <em>it&rsquo;s very unlikely that bugs are
introduced by miscommunication between non-adjacent layers</em>. This means, that
as long you have made sure to test each layer boundary, you should in be pretty
confident that the application works as a whole. For example, in the image
above, you can see that all the curly braces to the right are overlapping. Each
curly brace is a set of narrow integration tests.</p><p>Could there be bugs that are introduced by pairs on non-adjacent layers? Yes,
but like I said very unlikely. Ignoring when you&rsquo;ve actually missed a narrow
integration test case, you <em>might</em> see issues such as</p><ul><li>application using too much resources (CPU, memory, I/O&mldr;) when all
components are put together.</li><li>low-level concurrency-related issues.</li><li>memory corruption bugs.</li></ul><p>These days, bugs like these are pretty uncommon. My recommendation is that you
focus on implementing those narrow integration tests first if you can.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
