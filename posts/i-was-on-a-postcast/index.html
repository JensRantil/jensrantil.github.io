We recorded it on the 8th of
December, it was published & <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgia-benton-b899ba13b_evo-nordics-475-sre-ownership-activity-7156768373861699584-FClp?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>announced</a> on the 25th of January, and I finally took the time
to listen to it fully - and vetted it worthy of sharing. &#x1f605; I
thought I would write a little bit about the experience.</p><div class="notice info"><div class=notice-title><i class="fa-solid fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden=true></i>Info</div><div class=notice-content><p>Links to the podcast:</p><ul><li><a href=https://soundcloud.com/user-333104763/evo-nordics-475-sre-ownership class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Soundcloud</a></li><li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0tRXkQyDOKUYW29V3KDxFI?si=aKYJSSnrTmq7xPtzwUlBqg" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Spotify</a></li><li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/evolution-exchange-nordics-podcast/id1572442468?uo=4" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Apple Podcast</a></li></ul></div></div><h2 id=how-it-all-began>How it all began
<a class=heading-link href=#how-it-all-began><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>It all started with me being reached out to by Georgia (the host) at <a href=https://evolutionjobs.com class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Evolution
Jobs</a>. Alex, one of the podcast guests that I had met a few weeks
earlier had recommended me and had an idea for a topic that he thought we all
would be able to contribute to - <strong>SRE & Full Ownership</strong>. I accepted. I felt
this was a topic I would naturally be able to have a conversation around and
have opinions on; The &ldquo;Full Ownership&rdquo; part was very close to <em>DevOps as a
Culture</em> which is something near and dear to me - and I have been working in
the SRE space for many years.</p><p>During the initial meet-and-greet with Georgia, she was very explicit about the
setup. Christian, Alex, and I, would all prepare one question that we wanted to
discuss with the group. These questions would then be circulated beforehand
such that we all could prepare. This felt good as it allowed me to prepare a
little bit with some notes in preparation for the actual recording!</p><p>Georgia also went over the exact agenda for the actual podcast recording a few
weeks later: Before the actual recording, we would do a small exercise to get
to know each other and relax a bit. Once that was done, the actual recording
would start where we would go around the table, read our questions, and discuss
it. Georgia would facilitate the conversations.</p><p>Luckily Christian, Alex, and I, all work and live in Stockholm. This allowed us
to grab lunch in central Stockholm to get to know each other a little bit
beforehand. That said, we made it quite clear that we were <em>not</em> to discuss our
actual podcast topics. :)</p><h2 id=recording-it>Recording it
<a class=heading-link href=#recording-it><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>I&rsquo;m generally a person who does not get nervous until about 5 minutes before
something starts. The podcast recording was no different. We did our
socializing warmup exercise and the podcast was <em>on</em>. Everything was recorded
over Micro$oft Teams which allowed us to use the regular chat and &ldquo;raise hand&rdquo;
functions.</p><p>I was really happy I had prepared with notes - particularly my intro.
Similarly, when giving a presentation, I find it most important to not get
stuck on the starting line. Notes help. Once, we had started getting into the
conversation, it was fairly easy.</p><h2 id=the-result>The result
<a class=heading-link href=#the-result><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Recording a podcast was fun and I feel proud of myself for doing it! Listening
to my voice, my &ldquo;uhms&rdquo; and &ldquo;ahs&rdquo;, is always tricky and makes me self-critical.
Ignoring that, I think I managed to squeeze in a fair amount of knowledge,
opinions, and reflections in there. I was also surprised how much I learned
about myself when listening to myself critically; I think I was too
excited/nervous a few times which made it hard for me to find words or express
myself, and I feel challenged to get better at it next time.</p><p>As with any free-flowing conversation like what we had, there is always a risk
of the conversation becoming jumpy or different people talking at different
lengths. I think both of those things happened in our final podcast. Possibly a
bit more facilitation could have helped there.</p><p>If you haven&rsquo;t had the time to listen, <a href=https://evolutionjobs.com/exchange/evo-nordics-475-sre-ownership/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>have a go</a>! I hope
you will enjoy it!</p><h2 id=addendum>Addendum
<a class=heading-link href=#addendum><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>The other day I read the article <a href=https://www.evalapply.org/posts/how-to-not-die-by-a-thousand-cuts/index.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>How To Not Die By A Thousand Cuts. Or, How To
Think About Software Quality</a>. It reminded me how coupled SRE and QA are.
The article wrote about many of the things we spoke about, but using &ldquo;Software
Quality&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;SRE&rdquo;. Maybe useful don&rsquo;t know!</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>Â©
