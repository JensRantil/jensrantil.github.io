I use this principle particularly when someone proposes something I strongly disagree with &ndash; or know will fail &ndash; but for cases where I can&rsquo;t affect the actual decision. Usually, it is for cases where I am &ldquo;consulted&rdquo; or &ldquo;informed&rdquo; in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>RACI</a> sense.</p><p>&ldquo;Raise and Release&rdquo; involves a two-step process. The &ldquo;Raise&rdquo; step means, I gather up feedback in written text where I explain why I think the proposal is a Bad Idea&#8482;&#xfe0f;. This can be in a public chat or as a feedback comment in an RFC document. For really complex feedback, I have even found myself writing up a 2-pager or a public blog post<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> explaining my reasoning.</p><p>I have found it important for the feedback to have a linkable URL. By doing so, I can share a link to my feedback in any conversation, now or in the future.</p><p>If I believe there is a very big/expensive/serious failure approaching, I have obviously also notified a manager.</p><p>The &ldquo;Release&rdquo; step involves two things:</p><p>First, I let the involved people know that &ldquo;This is my feedback on why I think this idea is a bad one, but I will let <em>you</em> decide if you would like to progress with it or not&rdquo;. That is, I make it very clear this is not my decision to make.</p><p>Secondly, I move on and release this issue from my responsibilities, my emotional burden, the decision process, and the outcome&rsquo;s consequences. Poff. I have done my part.</p><h2 id=an-example>An example
<a class=heading-link href=#an-example><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Some time ago I worked with some engineers who proposed to introduce a public HTTP API that worked with batches of items. Having had many years of (bad) production experience with this (and knowing the pain of API deprecations), I knew that there were many pitfalls with the solution. However, this project and the implementation decisions were not mine.</p><p>Initially, I voiced my concerns informally. But I noticed that they were taken rather lightly. This led me to write my blog post <a href=/posts/downsides-of-batch-apis/>&ldquo;The downsides of batch APIs&rdquo;</a> which I shared as a link in the RFC document as well as in a public chat.</p><p>I moved on. Luckily, the engineers picked up my feedback and decided to avoid batched APIs. Win!</p><p>(A bonus for writing my thoughts as a blog post is that I am now able to share a link to the blog post if I am ever in a similar position in the future, independent of my employer.)</p><h2 id=closing-thoughts>Closing thoughts
<a class=heading-link href=#closing-thoughts><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Throughout my years, I have found the &ldquo;Raise and Release&rdquo; principle to be really helpful; It has covered any personal repercussions for failures but also saved the organizations I have worked from some expensive mistakes &ndash; when people have been willing to listen. By sharing my feedback in public, I have had a URL to share in future conversations with engineers and managers, or even future employers.</p><p>Personally, the &ldquo;Raise and Release&rdquo; principle has also helped me to not waste my social capital or spend any energy on decisions I simply could not affect.</p><p>Not all hills are worth dying on. With the &ldquo;Raise and Release&rdquo; principle, some of my employers&rsquo; failures are no longer <em>my</em> failure.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>If I ever write a blog post about something, I obviously leave my employer out of it.
