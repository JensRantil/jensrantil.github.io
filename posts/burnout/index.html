Both times, the following held:</p><ul><li><strong>Tight deadline.</strong> I had an urgent project on my shoulders with a very very
tight deadline. In one of the cases, I also had a planned vacation starting
within a week - and I feared having to cancel the entire sailing trip with
my friends (it was my boat).</li><li><strong>Low capacity.</strong> I had known the project was coming any day for weeks but
was unable to start working on it. As such, my mental and emotional capacity
was already strained.</li><li><strong>I was alone.</strong> I had no one to delegate to and was solely on my own. I was
the only person who knew the (DevOps) work that needed to be done. Despite
me flagging for 6-12 months that I needed to offload some responsibilities.
I felt helpless.</li><li><strong>Constant nudging.</strong> The project was the highest priority project in the
company. Everyone kept asking me how it was going, requesting status
updates, or if they could help (they could not - see the previous bullet).</li><li>I <strong>worked day and night</strong>.</li></ul><p>Strictly speaking, I was not fully burned out; I was able to get out of bed, but
my entire body was shaking, I was unable to sleep, was annoyed, body
temperature was fluctuating between too hot & too cold, and I had anxiety.</p><p>My stress threshold was significantly lower for a few years (and still is) and
these experiences have made me have a deep respect and compassion for people
dealing with burnout. Getting out of it is slow and painful. What makes matters
worse, you can&rsquo;t <em>work</em> yourself out of it.</p><p>These experiences have also had a large impact on my career and the way I
approach work ever since:</p><p>I no longer accept being the only person who knows something. I build teams, I
share knowledge, I pair/mob/ensemble program, I document things, and I work in
small increments such that someone else can take over at any point in time.</p><p>I no longer accept being the sole person having access to something. My
northern star vision is for everyone on the <em>same team with the same role to
have the same access permissions</em>. There can be exceptions during onboarding,
but that&rsquo;s about it.</p><p>I practice saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s hard, but I will not accept the alternative
fallout of getting burned out.</p><p>I respect a &ldquo;no&rdquo; from other people much more.</p><p>I try to support people in stressful situations as much as I can. This also
makes me a much better teammate, and generally a more compassionate person.</p><p>About a year ago, I was in a similar position with a project. This was at least
four years since my last encounter. I was annoyed and stressed. After a
day or two I realized the project had all the similarities with my previous two
occasions of burnout. With the support of a great manager, I said no, and moved
out of the project to a supporting role.</p><p>I guess my near-burnout still lives in my body.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
